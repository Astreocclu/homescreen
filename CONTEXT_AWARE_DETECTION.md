# 🎯 Context-Aware AI Detection System

## 🚀 **Enhanced Intelligence Based on Screen Type**

Your AI now understands **different use cases** for each screen type and focuses on the most relevant areas!

## 🔍 **How Context-Aware Detection Works**

### **🔒 Security Screens**
**Focus**: Windows and doors for break-in prevention
```
AI Prompt: "Focus on WINDOWS and DOORS that need security protection.
Look for:
- All windows (especially ground floor and accessible)
- Entry doors and back doors
- Sliding glass doors
- French doors
- Any opening that could be a security vulnerability"
```

**Detection Priority**:

### **🌿☀️ Lifestyle/Solar/Environmental Screens** (Grouped Together)
**Focus**: Patios, porches, outdoor living spaces, and sun-exposed windows
```
AI Prompt: "Focus on PATIOS, PORCHES, OUTDOOR LIVING SPACES, and SUN-EXPOSED WINDOWS for comfort, privacy, and energy efficiency.
Look for:
- Patio areas and outdoor seating spaces
- Covered porches and verandas
- Outdoor dining and entertainment areas
- Pool areas and outdoor living spaces
- Large openings to outdoor spaces
- South and west-facing windows (sun exposure)
- Large windows and sliding glass doors
- Windows in living areas, bedrooms, offices
- Any area that would benefit from UV protection, privacy, or comfort"
```

**Detection Priority**:
