## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Scripts Don't Execute**
1. Check file permissions: `chmod +x *.sh`
2. Verify git is installed: `git --version`
3. Check current directory: `pwd`
4. Manually execute commands from `COMMIT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`

### **If Git Commands Fail**
1. Initialize git: `git init`
2. Configure user: `git config user.name "Your Name"`
3. Configure email: `git config user.email "your@email.com"`
4. Check .gitignore exists and is properly configured

### **If Files Are Missing**
1. Verify you're in the correct directory: `/home/reid/projects/homescreen`
2. Check file existence: `ls -la`
3. Review the project structure in `REPOSITORY_ANALYSIS.md`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

After successful execution, you should see:
- [ ] Clean git history with 21-22 commits
- [ ] All commits follow conventional commit format
- [ ] No sensitive information committed
- [ ] All major project components tracked
- [ ] Repository ready for team collaboration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline can be easily implemented

## 🚀 Next Steps After Completion

1. **Set up remote repository** (GitHub/GitLab)
2. **Push to remote**: `git remote add origin <url> && git push -u origin main`
3. **Configure branch protection rules**
4. **Set up CI/CD pipeline**
5. **Create contribution guidelines**
6. **Set up automated testing**
7. **Configure monitoring and alerts**
