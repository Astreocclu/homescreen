# HOMESCREEN VISUALIZER - PROJECT GOAL

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: For complete project documentation, see PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md**

## QUICK REFERENCE - WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

This is an **AI-powered web application** for visualizing **PHYSICAL WINDOW AND DOOR SCREENS** on homes.

**NOT digital displays or security cameras - PHYSICAL mesh screens for windows/doors.**

## CORE OBJECTIVE
Generate realistic visualizations of how **physical window/door screens** will look on a customer's home to help sales representatives close deals.

## SCREEN TYPES WE VISUALIZE

### Security Screens
- **Stainless steel mesh** for break-in protection
- **Heavy-duty security mesh** with thicker patterns
- **Fine mesh security** for visibility + protection
- Brands: Boss Security Screens, etc.

### Lifestyle Screens
- **Phifer-style** decorative screens
- **Twitchell-style** premium screens
- **Solar screens** for UV/heat blocking
- **Pet-resistant** thicker weave screens
- **Standard fiberglass** basic screens

## PRIMARY USE CASE
1. Sales rep visits customer's home
2. Takes photo of house exterior
3. Uploads to app, selects screen type
4. **AI generates realistic visualization** showing screens installed
5. Customer sees exactly how their home will look
6. Increased sales conversion

## CURRENT STATUS
✅ **Working:** User auth, image upload, progress tracking, multi-image display
🔄 **Next:** AI vision integration for intelligent screen application
📋 **Future:** Reference photo learning, advanced realism

## KEY TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
- **Django REST API** with JWT authentication
- **React frontend** with drag & drop upload
- **PIL/Pillow** image processing
- **Real-time progress** tracking and status updates
- **Multi-image generation** (3 variations per request)

## AI VISION INTEGRATION (NEXT MILESTONE)
Need to integrate **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision** or similar to:
1. **Analyze reference photos** of previous installations
2. **Learn realistic screen patterns** and textures
3. **Intelligently apply screens** to customer photos
4. **Generate multiple variations** with different screen types

**This is the key differentiator - AI that learns from real installations to create realistic visualizations.**
